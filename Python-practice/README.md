## `two_cnt_sum.py`
Description: It is similar to the problem in Leetcode, which is two sum. However, this problem find two sum which is not the number itself, but the count of the number. For example, the sum defined in the problem for A and B is 5. Then the list is `[A, B, A, A, B]`. The reason is that A shows up three times and B shows up two times, and sum up with five times. If I give you A and the sum is 5, then you should give me B as the answer.
